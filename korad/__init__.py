Hi Mango-kid,

I am writing you here because I did not find any of your contact. 
I am trying to do a connection with my Korad KEL103 but it does not communicate.
In phycharm it gives this error:
    data, server = self.sock.recvfrom(1024)
socket.timeout: timed out

This is my setup connection parameters: kel = KEL103.kel103("192.168.1.181", "192.168.8.128", 18190)

What could be the problem, what do you think?

Please help me!

My email is: magyar.andras.tamas@outlook.com

Thank you,
Andras Tamas Magyar
